This is a tool to help you open many urls in your spreadsheet faster

- First, upload your spreadsheet by clicking the "UPLOAD FILE" button.
- Then, you have two options: Opening the urls in a specific column or a specific row.
- There are three input fields:
  + First input: The label or number indicating the specific column or row respectively.
  + Second input: The number of browser tabs you want to open each time. Why? Because opening too much tabs will make your computer extremely laggy.
  + Third input: The tool will divide all your urls in the row or column selected into many subtasks according to the number from second input. For example, the column you choose has 12 links, and you want to open 3 tabs each time. The tool then divide your 12 links into 12/3 = 4 subtasks:
      + subtask1: from link 1 to link 3
      + subtask2: from link 4 to link 6
      + subtask3: from link 7 to link 9
      + subtask4: from link 10 to link 12
   So if you type number 2 into this input, it will open all the links from 4 to 6.
- After typing all necessary information, you can click the "OPEN" button to make it works
- You can use the "CLOSE" button to close all the links you have just opened. Note that each time you click the "CLOSE" button, it will close a number of tabs equal to the number from the second input.
